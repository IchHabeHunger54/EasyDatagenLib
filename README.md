A library that provides utilities for modded datagen. These include:

- A large collection of datagen classes for a wide variety of mods
- Helper methods to generate similar recipes for different mods (e.g. 5 variants of ore processing in one method call)
- An easy-to-use way to add datagen support for your own JSON-driven systems, both recipes and non-recipes
- 1.19.3+: Support for datapack registry generation

To get started, please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/MinecraftschurliMods/EasyDatagenLib/wiki).

This library does not import any preexisting mods into the environment; instead, it replicates modded JSON formats.
That way, we do not need to wait for other mods to update, and only reflect actual feature changes.

If you want to see your own mod added, please open a pull request, or come talk to us on the Discord. If you need
support using this library, feel free to ask on the Discord as well.
