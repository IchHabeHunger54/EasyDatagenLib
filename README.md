**Note:** This library is still a work in progress. The features below are what is planned to be the final contents,
only some of them are already implemented.

A library that provides utilities for modded datagen. These include:

- A large collection of datagen classes for a wide variety of mods
- Helper methods to generate similar recipes for different mods (e.g. 5 variants of ore processing in one method call)
- An easy-to-use way to add datagen support for your own JSON-driven systems, both recipes and non-recipes

This library does not import any preexisting mods into the environment; instead, it replicates modded JSON formats.

If you want to see your own mod added, please open a pull request, or come talk to us on the Discord!
